Please fork this repository and paste the github link of your fork on Microsoft CMT. Detailed instructions are on Coursera under Week 1: Course Project Overview/Week 9 Activities.

## Setup Dependencies

To install the app for development, first ensure you have NodeJS available. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to install Node Version Manager (NVM). Then run the following command to install NodeJS.

```
nvm install 14.18.1
```

Then ensure you have the package manager `yarn` installed by doing `npm install -g yarn`. Next, navigate to the `hacker-news-jobs` directory and run `yarn install`. That will install all the depenencies to build the extension.

To build the extension, run `yarn build`. That will output build files to `hacker-news-jobs/build`. Open Chrome and go to the url `chrome://extensions`. Select "Load unpacked" to install this local extension from the directory `hacker-news-jobs/build`. The extension should be available in your Chrome browser now.

To test the install, go to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), then open the extension and click "Send Message." The links on Hacker News should turn red. After updating files, you need to run `yarn build` and reload the specific extension again in `chrome://extensions`.

## Key File Structure

The main files are `hacker-news-jobs/src/App.tsx` and `hacker-news-jobs/src/chrome/content.ts`. `App.tsx` is a pop-up defined using the framework React. We can define our user form there. It has a simple button that communicates with the `content.ts` script, which gets loaded into the Hacker News page. The file `content.ts` listens for a message from the extension and executes a function. There's other options for also running a background script. The `hacker-news-jobs/manifest.json` file provides the extension information for Chrome. It identifies what file should get treated as the extension pop-up vs injected into specific pages.

The `.ts` file extension means a file is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The buid process transpiles TypeScript to JavaScript that the browser can understand. It will also convert React components to elements the browser can handle.

## Testing

To test the search results, we used the following queries and measured precision @ 10 recommendations:

* frontend javascript
* data science python
* devops infrastructure

We documented our findings [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-DkfujZc6qVkG42upE_-XXvm2gTSTwqhBM8Nog3A8jg/edit?usp=sharing). That Google Sheet is accessible using UIUC logins. We noted the original order of the results against the resulting search order as well. Most of the results pulled from postings far below the default Hacker News ranking.

To facilitate the testing, we log the search results along with their original order in the console. Open the Chrome developer console and look for the log output "Ranked output from search." The objects printed after that are the search results and include their original order.
